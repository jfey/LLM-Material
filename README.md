# Machine Learning, LLM, Image Recognition 

After always ending up north of 500 browser tabs open with (mostly) LLM-related content i try to migrate the links into 
this repo. This allows also for a better organisation and commentary. I try to add comments per link/topic. The content 
here is (currently) mainly used to help me to remember certain information, which i found along the way. This page focuses 
on LLM topics. Other topics are covered on dedicated pages.

## Image recognition

[image recognition.md](image%20recognition.md)


# LLM-Material

## Prompts

[Fuck You, Show Me The Prompt](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/prompt/). _In this blog post, I’ll show you how you can intercept
API calls w/prompts for any tool, without having to fumble through docs or read source code. I’ll show you how to setup and 
operate mitmproxy with examples from the LLM the tools I previously mentioned._ Lots of interesting details about prompts
and ways of how to analyze whats going on.


## Vector Databases

[Brief Backgrounder](vector_database_backgrounder.md)

[Vector DB Comparison](https://vdbs.superlinked.com/) is a very handy site, listing a lot of database and comparing features.

### Database Engines


### Libraries Used Internally

[Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)


### Tools

[VectorIO](https://github.com/AI-Northstar-Tech/vector-io). _This library uses a universal format for vector 
datasets to easily export and import data from all vector databases._

[VectorFlow](https://github.com/dgarnitz/vectorflow). _Simple API endpoint that ingests large volumes of raw data,
processes, and stores or returns the vectors quickly and reliably_
