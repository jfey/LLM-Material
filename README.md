# LLM-Material

After always ending up north of 500 browser tabs open with LLM-related content i try to migrate the links into 
this repo. This allows also for a better organisation and commentary. I try to add comments per link/topic. The content 
here is (currently) mainly used to help me to remember certain information, which i found along the way.  


## Vector Databases

[Brief Backgrounder](vector_database_backgrounder.md)

[Vector DB Comparison](https://vdbs.superlinked.com/) is a very handy site, listing a lot of database and comparing features.

### Database Engines


### Libraries Used Internally

[Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)


### Tools

[VectorIO](https://github.com/AI-Northstar-Tech/vector-io). This library uses a universal format for vector 
datasets to easily export and import data from all vector databases.

[VectorFlow](https://github.com/dgarnitz/vectorflow). Simple API endpoint that ingests large volumes of raw data,
processes, and stores or returns the vectors quickly and reliably

[Building Generative AI Applications Using MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/library/vector-search/building-generative-ai-applications-using-mongodb?xs=533003): Harnessing the Power of Atlas Vector Search and Open Source Models.
Nice intro into using MongoDB as a VectorDB. Easy to follow examples 

[Multimodal Vector-Search Using CLIP on MongoDB](https://docs.superduperdb.com/docs/use_cases/vector_search/multimodal_image_search_clip/). This notebook demonstrates how SuperDuperDB can perform multimodal searches using the VectorIndex. It highlights SuperDuperDB's flexibility in integrating different models for vectorizing 
diverse queries during search and inference. In this example, we utilize the CLIP multimodal architecture.
